# PROJECT PURPOSES ONLY!
# SABS-Website-Revamp

Hello everyone! My name is Neon and I am a student at Saint Anne de Beaupre School (SABS) in Quezon City, Philippines. I am very excited to share with you that I will be leading a team of talented and passionate students to revamp our school's website.

# Development
We have decided to embark on this project to redesign and rebuild our school's website from scratch. We will use modern web development tools and techniques to create a responsive, user-friendly and attractive website that will highlight our school's strengths and values. We will also update the content and features of the website to make it more relevant and informative for our visitors.

# About us
Our school has a website that was launched in 2010. It contains information about our school's history, vision, mission, programs, admissions, facilities and activities. The website's address is sabs.edu.ph. However, we feel that the website is outdated and does not reflect the current achievements and innovations of our school. We want to create a new website that will showcase our school's excellence and diversity, as well as engage our stakeholders and prospective students.

We are also looking forward to collaborating with other students who have skills or interests in web design, web development, content writing, graphic design or photography. If you are one of them, please feel free to contact us at nf.cruz@sabs.edu.ph.
